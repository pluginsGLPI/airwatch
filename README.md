## How does it work

The plugin requests Airwatch REST API for:

* general informations (name, OS, etc)
* network informations
* software
* airwatch specific information (enrollement, compliance and comprimse checks, etc)

A XML inventory file is done using the data above, and sent to FusionInventory, using curl.
Computers are then created, representing Airwatch devices.

For each device managed by Airwatch, an "Airwatch" tab is displayed in GLPi. This tab shows Airwatch specific informtions, and allows user to force an inventory

You need, at least, to have the right to see a computer to access Airwatch informations.
